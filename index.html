    <p><b>Key takeways</b></p>
<p>1. A webpage is a text docuemtn written in a language called html. Web browsers read these docuemtns and then interpret and display them.<br>
<em>World wide web consists of:</em><br>
- you, your computer (optimized for browsing files) and your browser<br>
- the internet (world's largest computer network)<br>
- servers (optimized for hosting files)<br>
These elements are connected by requests (initiated by you) and response (given by server)</p>
<p>2. Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.</p>
<p>3. Porgrammers need to write exactly the way a computer undestands - computer are <b>'stupid'</b></p>
<p>4. Programmers can't remember everything</p>
<p>5. Basis HTML vocabulary<br>
<b>Tag: </b>Containd within angled brackerts. Nust have both an opening and closing tag (unless it is a void tag like 'img' or 'br' that have no content and therefore do not need a closing tag.<br>
<b>Element : </b> Everything within a set of opening and closing tags<br>
<b>Attribute: </b>The property of an HTML element<br>
<em>Example 1: </em> <img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/modal_800/2014/09/too_good_for_grumpy_cat.jpg" alt="Grumpy Cat"><br>
<em>Example 2: </em> <a href="http://www.grumpycats.com/">www.grumpycats.com</a><p>
<p><b>Other key points</b></p>
<p>1. HTML: HyperText Markup Language.<br>
  HTML is made up of:<br>
  - text content (what you see)<br>
  - markup (what it looks like)<br>
  - references to other documents (e.g. imagess + videos)<br>
  - linkt to other pages
</p>
<p>2. Two types pf tags: inline and block. Block tags can specify both height and width (creatign an invisible box around the element<br>
  - 'br' tag is inline 'p' tag is block
  - 'span' tag is inline'; 'div' tag is block<br>
  <span>span example </span>this is how it behaves
  <div>div example</div>this is how it behaves
</p>
<p>3. HTML Documents have doctype, head, and body elements</p>
